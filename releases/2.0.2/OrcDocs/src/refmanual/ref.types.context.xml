	<title>Typing Contexts</title>

  <para>
  Whenever one or more variables is bound, the type checker records information from that
  binding to typecheck the uses of that variable in its scope. This information is stored
  in a <indexterm significance="preferred"><primary>typing context</primary></indexterm><firstterm>typing context</firstterm>, 
  which is just a sequence of variable names and their types. 
  When an expression is in the scope of many bindings, the
  typechecker will carry a composite context of all of the typing contexts created by all
  of those bindings. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
  <link linkend="ref.declarations">Declarations</link>, <link linkend="ref.combinators">combinators</link>, and <link linkend="ref.expressions.call.function">function calls</link> all bind variables. 
  Often, only a single variable is bound, so only one binding is generated. 
  However, <link linkend="ref.patterns">pattern matching</link> may generate an entire set of variable bindings.
  </para>
  
  <para>
  When a variable is typechecked, its type is found by first looking in the most recent 
  context (i.e. from the nearest binding), and if its type is not found there, proceeding
  further and further out in scope. If the variable is not in the typing context, then it
  is a free variable, which is a syntactic error.
