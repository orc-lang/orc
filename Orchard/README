Welcome! This archive includes Web services and job servers
for the Orc language.

There are three products in this archive:
1. A Mac OS X application that provides a stand-alone demonstration of
   the Orchard environment.
2. A set of JAR/WAR files that provide a stand-alone demonstration of
   the Orchard environment.
3. A set of JAR/WAR files that can be deployed into a Java Servlet
   container that provide the Orchard environment.

Orchard runs in a Java SE 6 runtime environment.  Required JARs are
included here, in the "lib" directory.

There are numerous examples of Orc programs accessible in the
