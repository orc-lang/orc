<title>An Introduction to Orc</title>

<para>
An Orc program is an <firstterm>expression</firstterm>. 
Complex Orc expressions are built up recursively from simpler expressions. 
Orc expressions are <firstterm>executed</firstterm>;
an execution may interact with external services, and <firstterm xml:id="terms.publish">publish</firstterm> some number of 
values (possibly zero). Publishing a value is similar to returning a value with a <code language="java">return</code> statement
in an imperative language, or evaluating an expression in a functional language, except that an execution may
publish many times, at different times, or might not publish at all. An expression which does not publish is
called <firstterm>silent</firstterm>.  
</para>

<para>
An execution <firstterm>halts</firstterm> when it is finished; it will not interact with any more services,
publish any more values, or have any other effects.
</para>

<para>
Different executions of the same expression may have completely different
behaviors; they may call different services, may receive different responses from the same site,
and may publish different values.
</para>
