		<title><code>include</code>:  Include Orc File</title>

			<para>
It is often convenient to group related declarations into units that can be
shared between programs. The <code><indexterm><primary>include</primary></indexterm>include</code> declaration offers a simple
way to do this. It names a source file containing a sequence of Orc declarations;
those declarations are incorporated into the program as if they had textually
replaced the include declaration. An include declaration may occur wherever any other
declaration occurs, even in a nested scope. An included file may itself contain 
<code>include</code> declarations.  Included files may come from local files, any
URI recognized by the Java library (http, https, ftp, etc.), and include resources
found in the Orc JAR files.
