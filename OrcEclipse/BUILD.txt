Project OrcEclipse

The Orc programming language Eclipse plug-in project

From the Orc team in the Department of Computer Science
at The University of Texas at Austin.

--------


PREREQUISITE:

Install IMP, the Eclipse IDE Meta-tooling Platform from the IMP Eclipse
Update Site (Eclipse menu item Help > Install new Software...)  Add the
site with Name: IMP Update Site,
          URL: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/imp/updates/
From that site, select all categories and install.



BUILD PROCEDURE -- FOR A LOCAL BUILD:

Note: This Eclipse plug-in will build in the Eclipse IDE.  There is no
      stand-alone build script.

      (The buildAdditionalTasks.xml file supplies additional build
       tasks, but is not a full build script.)

1. Check out this project, OrcEclipse, and the required projects:
   - OrcJava
   - WebSite

2. Clean and re-build all projects.



BUILD PROCEDURE -- FOR A RELEASE PUBLICATION:

Note: This Eclipse plug-in will build in the Eclipse IDE.  There is no
      stand-alone build script.

      (The buildAdditionalTasks.xml file supplies additional build
       tasks, but is not a full build script.)

1. Check out this project, OrcEclipse, and the required projects:
   - OrcJava
   - WebSite
   - OrcEclipseFeature
   - OrcEclipseUpdateSite

2. If this is a new Orc release number:
   Sync the orc-*.jar filename's version component from the OrcJava
   project to OrcEclipse's build files in three places:
   - In OrcEclipse project properties > Java Build Path, select the
     orc-*.jar entry, press Edit..., and select the orc-*.jar of the
     new release.
   - In the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF manifest file, update the
     Bundle-ClassPath attribute path to include the new release's
     JAR (in lib/orc-*.jar)
   - In the build.properties file, update the jars.extra.classpath
     entry to specify the new release's JAR (lib/orc-*.jar)

3. Bump the plug-in's version number: Open the Plug-In Overview page
   of the Plug-In Manifest Editor, accessed by opening the MANIFEST.MF
   file and selecting the Overview tab.  Change the Version field per
   the Eclipse rules:

     In Eclipse, version numbers are composed of four segments:
     three integers and a string respectively named
     major.minor.service.qualifier.

     Increment major when incompatible/breaking changes have been made
     to an interface. Reset minor and service to 0 in this case.

     Increment minor when a plug-in changes in an "externally visible"
     way. Examples of externally visible changes include binary
     compatible API changes, significant performance changes, major
     code rework, etc. Another way to know when this version number
     should be changed is by exclusion: it should indicate changes that
     are neither bug fixes (indicated by the service segment) nor
     breaking API changes (indicated by the major segment). When the
     minor segment is changed, the service segment is reset to 0.

     The service segment number must be incremented whenever there have
     been changes to a plug-in between releases that are not visible in
     its interface. For example, a bug has been fixed in the code, the
     plug-in manifest has changed, documentation has changed, compiler
     settings have changed, etc.

   Leave the ".qualifier" string as literally ".qualifier" -- the build
   procedure automatically handles this segment.

4. In the OrcEclipseFeature project, bump the feature's version number:
   Open the Feature Overview page of the Feature Manifest Editor,
   accessed by opening the feature.xml file and selecting the Overview
   tab.  Change the Version field per the Eclipse rules (above).

5. Commit the changes in OrcEclipse's plug-in/build files and in
   OrcEclipseFeature's feature.xml file.

6. Clean and re-build all projects.

7. In the OrcEclipseUpdateSite project, add the newly built version of
   the feature: Open the Site Map page of the Site Manifest Editor,
   accessed by opening the site.xml file and selecting the Site Map
   tab.  Expand the "Orc programming language" category, then select
   (highlight) the category.  Press the Add Feature button, and pick
   the edu.utexas.cs.orc.orceclipse feature.  Select (highlight) the
   newly added feature. Make sure the feature is IN the category
   (indented the same as the others).  Press the Synchronize button
   and choose "Synchronize selected features only" and OK.  Then
   press the Build button.

8. Commit the changes in the OrcEclipseUpdateSite project.

9. Update the files on the Orc server by the following:
   ssh orc.csres.utexas.edu
   cd /var/lib/jetty6/webapps/root/eclipse_updates
   sudo svn up https://orc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/OrcEclipseUpdateSite .
